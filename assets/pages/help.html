<h2><u>Background</u></h2>
Is in 1918 and you are the American commander fighting back German forces in the Argonne Forest. You win the game
if you kill both of the German officers. However, if your two officers die, the Germans forces will overrun your troops. 

<h2><u>Units</u></h2>        
There are 5 types of soldiers: Officers, Riflemen, Snipers, Runners, and Heavy Weapon Specialists. Each icon
shows the solider type and country (American or German flag). Each icon represents one soldier. 

<h2><u>Turn sequence</u></h2>
<h3>Orders Phase</h3>        
You receive three (3) cards during the Orders phase to use during the Move and Attack phases. The max you can have
in your hand is five (5), so you may have to discard cards before you can proceed. Keep an eye on your units to
decide which cards to keep (for example, if you have no heavy weapons soldiers left, don't keep an Attack card
restricted to use by heavy weapons).
<h3><u>Move Phase</u></h3>        
You use Move cards to move a soldier. Each Move card has a number which is the number of spaces that solider can
move. Those moves can be diagonal or orthogonal.
<ul>
    <li>The "Z" ("Zig Zag") move card allows a solider to move like a knight in Chess.</li> 
    <li>A single soldier can only moce once per turn, except Runners who can move twice.</li>
    <li>You cannot move men into or through enemy soldiers.</li>
    <li>The German computer player may use a Negate card to cancel your move.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fight Phase</h3>        
You use Attack cards to kill enemy soldiers. The Attack card has a number that is the range of the attack. Those
attacks can be diagonal or orthogonal. The enemy soldier that is the target of the attack is automatically killed
and removed from the map.
<ul>
    <li>The "Z" ("Zig Zag") attack card is an attack with a range like a knight in Chess.</li>
    <li>Certain Attack cards are restricted to one type of solider. The Attack card will have that soldier type on
        the card. No other type of solider can use that card.</li>
    <lI>If a stack of soldiers is hit, then one man randomly be killed unless the attack was made by a heavy weapons
        specialist, then all the soldiers in the stack are killed.</lI>
    <li>The German computer player may use a Negate card to cancel your attack.</li>

    </ul>
